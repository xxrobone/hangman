# The process, my choices, issues i stumbled upon and reflection

I started with a wordle kind of thinking in logic, uisng words to check with words, looping the word and changing it to an array of letters, but got confused so I changed it to this project only taking one letter at a time as input checking for the with the word. 
Also tried out rock, paper, scissors game.

I have some logical issues that I learned a lot from and still working on. 

Have to get better at creating more functions for the different parts of the programs

- Started with a wordle kind of guessing game in mind
- changed to hangman kind with letter input instead of word input
- Some logics dont fall naturally in to my thoughts but Im working on it
- Learned a lot in this process and doing it over and over again. Still not where I wanna be in coding
