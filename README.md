# Hangman console (alert) game

## A js console or window (alert, prompt, confirm) game 4 frontend at CME

Goal is to make a console game with loops, conditionals, variables, const, let, logic etc.

I added some css, wanted to try out css 3d effects, but also created a button with a hover effect.
The button how ever has a eventlistener to start the game.
This assignment is not a html or css assignment so I havent separated the css or any files. 

Javascript is in the index.js file :D

# **Description:**

# The process, my choices, issues i stumbled upon and reflection

I started with a wordle kind of thinking in logic, uisng words to check with words, looping the word and changing it to an array of letters, but got confused so I changed it to this project only taking one letter at a time as input checking if its in the "secret" word. 
Also tried out rock, paper, scissors game.

I have some logical issues that I learned a lot from and still working on. 

Have to get better at creating more functions for the different parts of the programs

- Started with a wordle kind of guessing game in mind
- changed to hangman kind with letter input instead of word input
- Some logics dont fall naturally in to my thoughts but Im working on it
- Learned a lot in this process and doing it over and over again. Still not where I wanna be in coding

## What is Javascript?
Javascript is a so-called low-level language and it runs in the browser by compiling the code via javascript engine. This makes it possible for computers to read J's code and then display the content in our browsers.
V8 is chrome's compiler or data language translator, while e.g
spidermonkey is firefox, almost all browsers have their own js
translators but they are all very similar, some better and more compatible than others.

JS is a so-called single threaded language, it has only one stack, in other words 
- it can only do one thing at a time.

It works by having a data structure (memory heap) one
memory bank and a call stack (call stack) a stack that stores
details for code that runs in a sequence that is then called by the program / the browser through the WEB API, js engine and returns the response when it has been run, remove it from the queue and then run the next one, etc. in a loop.
Every time code is executed, it is executed through the call stack.
So variables that we store are in the memory (memory heap). If, for example, you have
too much unused code or large code in memory can happen
"memory gaps". So having too much in the global memory can lead to longer loading times, for example, or the program freezing.
So for it to work, "asynchronous" programming was needed
in order not to block the code, for example by inserting a timeout so that the code can continue to run while waiting for a response from, for example, a function or array that takes longer then it tells the WEB API that there is one coming
response after the timeout is complete and then it is executed from the call stack.
So when a code has been executed, and the program waits for the next bit that takes
longer, it continues to read the next code, the whole works through a loo which runs and checks what will come next.
